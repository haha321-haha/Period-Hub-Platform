# Standing Meditation, Baduanjin & Tai Chi for Menstrual Pain Relief: Evidence-Based Guide to Traditional Practices

## Introduction: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science

Menstrual pain affects women worldwide, with statistics showing that 50% to 90% of women experience dysmenorrhea during their reproductive years. Recent scientific research has increasingly validated that traditional Chinese wellness practices—standing meditation (Zhan Zhuang), Baduanjin exercises, and Tai Chi—offer safe, natural, and scientifically-proven pathways for menstrual pain relief.

## 🔬 Scientific Research Evidence

### International Research Findings

**Clinical Studies on Tai Chi for Menstrual Pain**:
