# Global Perspectives on Menstrual Pain Relief: Integrating Traditional Wisdom with Modern Science

## Introduction

Menstrual pain (medically known as dysmenorrhea) is a common health concern affecting millions of women of reproductive age worldwide. While modern medicine has made significant advances, traditional medical systems continue to offer diverse relief strategies. This article explores traditional menstrual pain relief methods from Indian Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and other cultures, combined with modern scientific research to provide comprehensive pain management solutions for women.

## Indian Ayurveda: Holistic Body-Mind Balance Therapy

Ayurvedic medicine is an ancient traditional medical system from India that emphasizes maintaining health through balancing body-mind energy. In Ayurveda, menstrual pain is considered a manifestation of Vata (wind energy) imbalance in the body.

### Dietary Therapy

Ayurveda recommends consuming warm, nourishing foods to balance wind energy. **Turmeric milk** is a commonly used home remedy, where curcumin has anti-inflammatory properties that can effectively relieve menstrual pain. Additionally, **cumin seed and aloe vera juice formula** is also considered a "panacea" for relieving menstrual pain. Cumin seeds have warming kidney, dispersing cold, regulating qi, and pain-relieving effects, while aloe vera juice has heat-clearing, intestine-moistening, and detoxifying benefits. Ayurveda also recommends consuming **warming foods** such as cooked vegetables and gentle spices like fennel and coriander seeds to promote digestion and blood circulation.

### Herbal Therapy

Ayurveda uses various herbs to relieve menstrual pain, some of which have potential analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects:

- **Dashamoola Kwatha (Ten Roots Decoction)**: Contains multiple herbs that may help inhibit COX-2 enzyme activity, thereby relieving pain.
- **Ashwagandha (Winter Cherry)**: May help regulate stress hormone cortisol and has analgesic effects.
- **Shatavari (Asparagus Root)**: Rich in phytoestrogens, may help relieve uterine spasms.
- **Artemisia (Mugwort)**: Has warming meridian, dispersing cold, activating blood, and resolving stasis effects, effectively relieving uterine contractions and reducing menstrual pain symptoms.
- **Angelica**: Rich in iron, not only improves anemia symptoms during menstruation but also relieves menstrual pain.
- **Astragalus**: Can improve body metabolism, promote blood circulation, thereby relieving menstrual pain symptoms.

### Lifestyle Practices

Ayurveda emphasizes reducing stress through yoga, meditation, and adequate rest to improve menstrual cycles. For example, **Supta Baddha Konasana (Reclined Bound Angle Pose)** and other menstrual-specific poses have been proven to effectively reduce pain scores. Additionally, **hot oil massage (Abhyanga)** using sesame oil and turmeric heated to 40°C for lower abdominal massage can promote prostaglandin metabolism and relieve menstrual pain. Ayurveda also recommends **regular sleep schedules** and **moderate yoga practice** to help regulate menstrual cycles.

## Traditional Chinese Medicine: Comprehensive Qi and Blood Harmonization

Traditional Chinese Medicine believes menstrual pain is caused by poor qi and blood circulation, cold stagnation, or dampness obstruction.

### Chinese Herbal Medicine

TCM prescribes herbal formulas based on individual conditions to harmonize qi and blood and unblock meridians. For example:

- **Warming the Meridians Decoction**: Activates TRPV1 channels to relieve spasms; clinical studies show pain scores can decrease by ≥50%.
- **Peach Kernel and Safflower Four-Substance Decoction**: Classic formula for activating blood and resolving stasis.
- **Bupleurum Liver-Soothing Powder**: Used for qi stagnation-type menstrual pain.
- **Blood Mansion Stasis-Expelling Pills**: Activates blood, resolves stasis, and regulates qi and blood.
- **Motherwort Granules**, **Ten-Flavor Blood-Activating Pills**, **Cinnamon Twig and Poria Capsules**, and other Chinese medicines work through regulating qi, activating blood, resolving stasis, warming meridians, dispersing cold, and stopping pain to fundamentally regulate body functions and relieve menstrual pain.

### Acupuncture Therapy

Acupuncture stimulates specific points such as Guanyuan and Sanyinjiao to promote endorphin release and relieve pain. Moxibustion at Guanyuan point is also a commonly used method. Additionally, **ear point pellet pressing** stimulates specific ear points such as uterus, endocrine, and Shenmen to regulate qi and blood and relieve menstrual pain symptoms.

### Food Therapy Methods

TCM food therapy emphasizes the principle that medicine and food share the same source, for example:

- **Brown Sugar Ginger Tea**: Warms meridians and disperses cold.
- **Angelica Egg Soup**: Nourishes and activates blood.
- **Mugwort Boiled Eggs**: Warms meridians and stops pain.
- **Red Date and Longan Tea**: Nourishes qi and blood.

## Traditional Methods from Other Countries and Regions

### Europe

- **St. John's Wort Essential Oil Massage**: Used in some European regions to relieve menstrual pain.
- **Chaste Tree Berry (Vitex agnus-castus)**: Regulates dopamine D2 receptors, treats premenstrual syndrome; clinical studies show pain relief rates up to 61%.
- **Ginger Tea Formula**: UK NHS recommends 3 cups daily (starting 3 days before menstruation).
- **Oregano**: Anti-inflammatory and analgesic.

### Arab Regions

- **Dates**: Rich in iron, magnesium, vitamins, and other nutrients; consuming during menstruation is believed to supplement energy and relieve fatigue.

### Native American Therapies

- **Raspberry Leaf Tea**: Rich in ellagic acid, soothes pelvic floor muscles; Mexico has over 300 years of clinical application history.

- **Ginger Tea**: 1g ginger powder daily can reduce prostaglandins by 40%.
